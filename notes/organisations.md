### Internal Stakeholders

**Shareholders/owners**

- In a large company, the main shareholders are not involved in day-to-day management (there are exceptions)
- They are investors looking for a return on their investments. Usually, in a higher value of shares or in dividends.
- The management of these larger companies is done by a board of directors and an executive management team.
- When a stakeholder feels their interests are threatened, they will try to influence the decisions of the directors.
  - They may express concerns about:
    - falling profit
    - lower dividend pays
    - a proposal to invest in a high-risk project
    - a proposed takeover bit
  - Mayor shareholders can discuss concerns with the chair and senior directors.
  - Shareholders can vote against a director during a general meeting. (restricted by company law)
- A majority shareholder owns enough shares to control the composition of the board and the decisions the company's directors make.

**Executive directors /managers**

- The board of directors can consist of executive(full-time employees) and non-executive members.
- Executive directors are managing the company; their interests are similar to those of senior executives who are not part of the board of directors.
- their interests are affected by:
  - job security
  - career opportunities
  - salary and extra benefits (pension, bonus, shares)
  - status
- Executive directors want to see the company grow; it has a positive impact on career opportunities, salary and status.
- Shareholders are more interested in profitability, dividends and the value of shares

**Other managers and employees**

- The lower and middle management employees are interested in making a promotion to senior levels.
- junior managers and employees are more concerned about:
  - job security
  - salary
  - satisfaction in the job
  - working conditions

**Agent - principal**

- In a large company, an agent relationship exists between owners (shareholders) and the directors.
- The directors are appointed by shareholders and required to act in their best interests.
- The owners act as 'the principals' and the director as the 'agents'

### External Stakeholders

- A business organisation often has many different external stakeholders

**Lender**

- A main concern from a lender is if the borrower can pay back debts, with interest and on time.
- A lender may get concerned when the company has major loans. When a borrower gets major debts, the risk increases that it cannot meet all the claims for interest and repayments.

**Suppliers**

- A supplier can give the business the option to buy on credit.
- their main interests are:
- Customer pays what is owed and will pay on time.
- Customer will continue to buy products
- Customer will follow good ethics and treat them fairly

- **Government**
- The government has an interest in all organisations, especially the larger ones.
  - A business pays taxes on profit; this makes the government have an interest in profitability
  - To keep a strong economy in a country, the government may encourage businesses to make investments.
  - The government wants to keep unemployment rates low
  - The government is responsible for regulations and restrictions. A business must comply with these laws.

**Customers**

- A custumer has a stack in a company because it expects value for money. They want to buy quality products.

**Local communities**

- When a large company creates many jobs in a specific area, the local community has an interest in the company.
- The concerns may be:
- The company is closing down operations or downscaling, which would affect local jobs and the local economy.

**The general public**
The actions of a company can affect major groups of people.
Areas of public concern could be:

- Environmental - pollution, and creating sustainable business
- public health - Manufacturing of food and medicines
- Monopolisation - Where large companies take over the market, leaving no space for small retailers or a fair market.
- corruption - Fraud by companies - bribery between companies, but also driving up prices for their own profit.

**Non-executive directors**

- Members of the board of directors who are not full-time employees of the company.
  - They bring expertise in the company which the executive directors don't have.
  - Job, security, bonuses, and status of power in the company do not affect them.
- It is good corporate governance to appoint external non-executive board members.

  - Individual external board members can help prevent a company from being one-sided or dominated by personal interests.

  ### Main stakeholders

- A main stakeholder can exercise the most significant influence.
- In a company, these are the board of directors and senior executives.
  - the directors will often be influenced by the opinion of shareholders
  - shareholders, especially the bigger ones, can take actions against the directors if they are unsatisfied.

### Connected stakeholders

- other groups might influence the decisions that directors and senior management make.
- A connected stakeholder:
  - Is not part of the decicion making
  - is not part of the permanent infrastructure of the organisation
  - is nevertheless very influential in shaping the future of organisations and the decisions of their leaders.
- They are:
  - non-executive directors
  - employees
  - key suppliers
  - key customers

### sources of internal power

- position
- personal charisma

### Sources of external power

- legal rights\*\*
- -publicity
- Control over resources
- Buying power
- Claim on resources

## Stakeholder mapping: Mendelow's power/interest matrix

- It is important to manage the stakeholders.
- Stakeholder mapping is a technique that can help senior managers to assess their main stakeholders and consider how to approach them.
- One approach is to evaluate a stakeholder on power and interest in a 2 X 2 matrix.
- the matrix compares:
- amount of interest the stakeholder has in a particular issue, on a scale ranging from not interested (0) to very interested (+10)
- the relative power of the stakeholder on a scale of very weak (0) to very powerful (+10)
- The key stakeholders are those with considerable power of influence and a high level of interest in the matter or decision that is considered.

- **little power + little interest** minimal effort needed to keep the stakeholder informed on the matter
- **little power + strong interest** keep them informed and explain why. A stakeholder should be up to date, even if they oppose what the organisation is doing.
- **high power + little interest** keep the stakeholder satisfied. Try to prevent situations where the stakeholder has a greater interest and will exercise their power.
- **high power + high interest** key players in the matter. It is essential to obtain and keep their support.

## stakeholders conflict of interest

Example:
The board of a company may set as an objective a 20% growth in annual profits.  
To do this, it may have to take the following measures:

- Reduce staffing levels and fire employees
- Switch to different suppliers of key materials that can be produced cheaply because they are in a country with cheap labour
- increase output that will increase levels of pollution. (Emile Woolf International Limited, 2025, p. 17)  
  Of course, a company should try to avoid major conflicts between stakeholder groups.  
  One approach is to apply principles of good corporate governance and to recognise the corporate social responsibility of companies.
