## Political and legal influence on business

Politics and laws have an extensive influence on an organisation and can affect nearly every aspect.
Multinationals have the additional complexity. Their activities can be affected by political and legislative conditions in each of the countries in which they operate.

A few examples of political and legal factors:

- Nationalisation of industry and privatisation: Industries partly owned by the state and state-owned companies become private businesses
- Transport and infrastructure: the quality of the infrastructure and the government policies.
- Education: The policies and quality of education affect the skills and knowledge of the citizens.
- Taxation and subsidies: Taxes and subsidies can be used to influence the economic position of a country.
- Environmental policy: A new policy concerning the environment can directly affect the organisation.

## Sources of legal authorities

Different legal authorities can introduce changes in the law.
The sources vary between countries but usually include:

- Supranational bodies
- National government
- Regional/local government with delegated power.

### Supranational bodies

A Supranational body is responsible for overseeing multiple countries. In some cases, it has the power to impose decisions on a national government.
To have the ability to impose those rules, the body needs to be supported by the government of that country.

Some examples:  
**European Union (EU)**

- _Type:_ Political and economic union of 27 European countries.
- _Role:_ Creates standard policies on trade, environment, competition, law, and free movement of people, goods, services, and capital.
- _Example:_ Single Market and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)**

- _Type:_ Independent standard-setting body.
- _Role:_ Develops and approves International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), used globally for financial reporting consistency.
- _Example:_ IFRS 16 on leases, which changed how companies report assets and liabilities.

**International Court of Justice (ICJ)**

- _Type:_ Principal judicial organ of the United Nations.
- _Role:_ Settles legal disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues.
- _Example:_ Border disputes and cases involving treaty interpretation.

**European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)**

- _Type:_ International court established under the European Convention on Human Rights.
- _Role:_ Hears cases where individuals, groups, or states claim violations of human rights by states.
- _Example:_ Cases on freedom of expression or right to fair trial.

**World Bank**

- _Type:_ International financial institution (part of the World Bank Group).
- _Role:_ Provides loans and grants for development projects in low- and middle-income countries.
- _Example:_ Funding infrastructure projects such as water supply systems or rural electrification.

**World Health Organisation (WHO)**

- _Type:_ Specialised agency of the United Nations.
- _Role:_ Directs and coordinates international health efforts, sets global health standards, and responds to public health crises.
- _Example:_ Global vaccination campaigns and COVID-19 pandemicÂ response.

## employment law

The purpose of employment laws is mainly to protect employees against exploitation or unfair treatment.
An organisation must be aware of the laws in every country where it operates and understand the consequences of non-compliance with local laws and regulations.
Some examples:

- Minimum income: A country might have a minimum income
- Working conditions: A variety of laws and regulations may apply. Max hours a week, minimal age, retirement age, breaks, and working conditions. This last one also addresses compliance with health and safety laws.
- Discrimination: Some countries have extensive laws against discrimination. UK: There are laws against discrimination on the grounds of physical disability, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and age .
- Redundancy: dismissal of employees on grounds of redundancy is not considered unfair dismissal. However, UK laws require an employer to consider transferring an employee to another job before deciding that redundancy is unavoidable.
- Unfair dismissal: There are some UK laws giving employees rights against unfair dismissal. When an employee brings in a legal claim, the employer needs to demonstrate that the dismissal was not for a reason as stated as unfair by law.

## data protection law

The purpose is to protect personal data that another person holds.  
Data protection legislation is designed to protect the private individual against the collection, holding and use of information about them without permission.

It might be considered illegal:

- Gather and hold information without a justifiable reason
- Make use of that information without permission.

Someone holding information has the legal obligation to:

- Make sure the data is accurate
- ensure the security of the data, so that it is not available to or accessed by unauthorised persons.

### What is personal data

- In Europe, any data about a living private individual, where the individual can be identified from the data.
- There is a difference between sensitive data and ordinary data. Additional legal requirements apply for sensitive data like a person's ethnical origin, political opinions, religion, trade union membership, physical or mental health and sexual habits or attitudes.
- In many European countries, anyone holding personal data needs to register that fact with a government department and provide details of the type of information they have and he reason why they keep it.
- Data protection legislation only applies to particular categories of information.

### Legal restriction on obtaining and using data

Organisations that hold and use personal data about individuals are required to comply with regulations.  
Failure to comply could expose the organisation to legal action by the individual with concerns or the authorities.

### Principles of data protecion and security:

Principles applied by UK law:

- Personal data must be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully
- personal data should be obtained only for one or more specified reasons
- personal information gathering and storing about individuals should be accurate, relevant and not excessive
- Data should not be kept longer than needed for its purpose.
- Personal data should be processed in accordance with the specific rights of individuals
- Personal data that is kept on individuals should be kept secure.

## competition law

Some countries have laws to encourage fair competition in markets and avoid anti-competitive practices.

### monopolies

A monopoly position means theoretically having 100% control over a market. There might be a law to prevent this from happening.
A monopoly in practice is usually defined as a significant influence, such as control of more than 30% of the market.

A company with a monopoly could ask for higher prices, something that would not be possible in a competitive market.
The risk of this anti-competitive behaviour is the main reason for laws restricting it.

- When a company grows and becomes a monopoly, the government might carry out an investigation, with a view to deciding whether measures should be taken to protect the public.
- When two companies propose a merger, the government might investigate it with a view to deciding if the merger is allowed, or if any conditions should be placed on the merger to protect the public.
- The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is carrying out these investigations in the UK

### Anti-collusion regulations

Collusion occurs when two or more business entities decide to agree on something beneficial to them but against the public interest.
In many cases, this is an agreement to raise prices and avoid competition on pricing. In many countries, this is a criminal offence.

### price controls

In some countries, the government might impose price controls on key products and services. (Water, electricity, and gas)
Official bodies may be established to monitor these "utility" companies.

## Responding to political and legal development

Large companies often use a lobby group to represent their interest by communicating with politicians and government officials.
In the UK, companies use firms to represent their interests when speaking to both UK and EU officials.
Lobby groups can help companies argue for or against proposed changes in the law, and help them understand the interests of the companies they represent.
