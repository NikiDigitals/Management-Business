## The external environment of an organisation

The environment of an organisation describes everything outside the organisation that affects what the organisation does and its actions.
Many come from external environmental influences and pressure, and differ according to the circumstances of the organisation.

One method to analyse environmental factors is by grouping them in 6 categories of **PESTEL** analysis:  
**P** - Political  
**E** - Economic  
**S** - Social, cultural and demographic  
**T** - Technoloigical  
**E** - Environmental (Ecological)  
**L** - Legal"

Another method to analyse the environment in which an organisation operates is the five forces model from Michael Porter.
This model identifies the industry of the firm as the key aspect and tries to take into account factors that influence attractiveness for different industries.

## The consequences of environmental change

Environmental changes can have a significant influence on the profitability and activities of an organisation.
They might affect planning and decision-making; for this reason, management must monitor environmental development to respond and take action.

### Environmental scan

PESTEL analysis, also called the environmental scan, is used to monitor the influences on the organisation, recognise the most significant ones and decide how the organisation should respond to them.  
The initial task for this ongoing activity is to identify factors in the environment that create threats or opportunities.

**Threats** are factors that might prevent the organisation from reaching its business objectives.  
**Opportunities** are factors that provide the organisation with opportunities to be more successful than its objectives.

### Understanding environmental factors

It is essential to be aware of influences from environmental factors on the activities of an organisation, and how the threats and opportunities can influence decision-making.
Although Monitoring and environmental scanning are often seen as strategic information, some awareness is necessary at all levels of the organisation.
The understanding of the business environment can be improved by paying attention to news about political and legal developments, economic conditions, social changes and technological developments.
